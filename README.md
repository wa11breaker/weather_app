# Weather App (Flutter + BLoC)

A simple weather app built using **Flutter** and the **BLoC** state management pattern. It fetches real-time weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## ðŸ”§ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather_app.git
   cd weather_app
   ```

2. **Add your OpenWeather API key**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

   ```
   OPEN_WEATHER_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Architecture

This app uses the **BLoC pattern** for state management. It separates business logic from the UI, making the code more scalable and testable.
